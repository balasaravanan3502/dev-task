○ Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of
books – either implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus<br /><br />
● Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and
Publish - date<br />
○ User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [ Title,
Author, Subject and publish-date
